# checking_fibonacci

Generating the Fibonacci sequence is a classic recursive problem. Recursion is when a function refers to itself to break down the problem itâ€™s trying to solve. 

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144....
In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation 

    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
with seed values  

   F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.

### calculating fibonaaci in simple math

0,1,1 - are the first values

Answer(1 + 1 = 2)

our set will look like;
0,1,1,2

Answer(1 + 2 = 3)

we add the new number to the set
0,1,1,2,3

Answer(2 + 3 = 5)

our set will look like 
0,1,1,2,3,5 ....
